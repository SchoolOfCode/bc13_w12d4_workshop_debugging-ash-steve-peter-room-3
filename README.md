# BC13_W12D4_Workshop_Debugging

The aim here is to understand how to debug your code when an error occurs and get familiar with the vs code debugging tool.

---

## Task 1 :

##### **(30mins)**

ðŸ‘‰ Do your research and get a brief understanding of how the vs code debugging tool works , we are not expecting you to become experts in using the debugging tool but to become master detective's at spotting bugs.

Here are a list of resources to help you problem solve and debug applications but make sure to find and gather your own resources like a true detective

- [Vs code's debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
- [Vs code's debugger , video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC91t9OvVHA)
- [Node.js debugging in VS Code ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC91t9OvVHA)

## Task 2 :

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 2a:

As detective developer's we need to have a keen eye for the details in our code, so for your first task we would like you take a look at the code given in task 2b and make a brief plan of how you would tackle solving the problem. ( no code is needed to be written at this point, only planning).

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 2b:

Now you have an idea of where the code maybe going wrong , put your detective skills to the test and figure out each problem with your new found debugger tool (Try to stay away from using console logs.).
When you feel you have been able to fix the bugs. There are some tests you can run to get visibility what is going on.

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 2c:

Great job sherlock, now get some more experience using the debugger in task 2c with something more complex(Try to stay away from using console logs). When you feel you have been able to fix the bugs. There are some tests you can run to get visibility what is going on.

---

## Task 3 :

ðŸ‘‰ This time we have a full stack todoList application that has several error types such as:

- Run time error's
- logical error's
- Syntax errors

Your task will be to debug the code and figure out what type of error you're getting from the above with your new found debugging skills.
Remember to use the Network tab in your browser's console when you need to figure out why the fetch request is not working.

---

## Bonus Task 4 :

ðŸ‘‰ If you were able to successfully complete task 2 and 3, now create your very own code snippets using functions with Errors for your fellow cohort members to debug, once complete share it in the slack.

if you are feeling extra confident maybe try add some tests to it.
